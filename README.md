# Phil Olarte – Product Designer Portfolio

Hi! I’m Phil, a product designer who loves turning messy, ambiguous problems into clear, intuitive experiences. This repository contains the source for my personal portfolio site – the place I use to share my work, process, and experiments.

## About Me

Recently received a master's degree in AI/ML and UX for AI experiences.

I’m happiest when I’m working end‑to‑end:

- Clarifying the problem and success metrics
- Exploring and validating concepts with real users
- Sweating the interaction details and visual polish
- Partnering closely with engineering to get solutions into production

My background combines product thinking, UX, and visual design, with enough front‑end knowledge to collaborate effectively with developers (and prototype when needed).

## About This Portfolio

This portfolio is built as a small product in itself. It’s designed to:

- Tell clear stories about my work: problems, constraints, decisions, and outcomes
- Show how I think: from early exploration through to shipped experiences
- Demonstrate craft: layout, hierarchy, motion, and interaction details
- Give a glimpse of personality through small experiments in "The Lab"

Under the hood, it’s a Next.js app with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. Hosted with Vercel backend. While the code is here for transparency, the real focus is the product thinking and design decisions. Worked in tandum with several different AI models in VS Code - impressive that OpenAI 5.1+ created very little bugs; a big jump from 4.1.

## What You’ll Find Here

- `app/home`, `app/work`, `app/thelab`: The main pages of the portfolio
- `data/projects.ts`: The projects and case studies featured on the site
- `components/`: Reusable UI pieces that make up the experience

## How I Work

**Thinking in systems**  
I like to define clear mental models and design systems that scale – from navigation to component patterns to content structure.

**Evidence‑driven decisions**  
I’m comfortable moving between qualitative insights, product analytics, and experimentation to guide direction and measure impact.

**Collaboration with engineering**  
I work closely with engineers early, so we can de‑risk ideas, simplify solutions, and ship with confidence.

**Bias for clarity**  
I aim to make complex things feel simple – for users, stakeholders, and teammates.
